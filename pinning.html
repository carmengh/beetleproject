            <p id="intro">There are thousands of different beetle species, so it is no question that beetle collecting is a popular hobby among many! Buying pinned/displayed beetles can be costly so most collectors pin beetles themselves. This page will go over basic information about pinning beetles.</p>

            <h2>Preparing Specimen</h2>
            <p>Before getting your dead beetle, you should prepare a few items:</p> 
            
            <ul>
                <li>An airtight container</li>
                <li>Cloth or paper towels</li>
                <li>Pins</li>
                <li>Styrofoam</li>
                <li>Tweezers</li>
                <li>Transparent/Translucent paper</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is important to rehydrate your beetle before you start moving any of its limbs. This is because dead beetles dry up and it is very hard to move its legs and body without snapping something off. First dampen your cloth or paper towel with water. Make sure to wring out excess water as it is important that your cloth/towel is not too wet. Place your moist cloth/towel inside your container. Put your beetle on top and gently cover it with the damp cloth/towel. Close your container and leave the beetle for 24-48 hours.</p>

            <h2>Pinning The Beetle</h2>
            <p>Now that your beetle is hydrated it should be ready to pin! Use your tweezers to pull its legs out from under its body and make sure its movements are smooth. Be sure to grab it near the middle of its legs to make it easier to loosen up. After loosening up the legs, take your tweezers and pop out its outer wings. It can be a little tough but imagine it as if you are popping the hood of a car. Once the elytra are out, place your beetle on top of your styrofoam block. Move its legs in the position you'd like and place pins at an angle around the beetle to hold it in place (make sure it's around the beetle and you aren't stabbing the actually specimen). Be sure to add pins around the beetles head and body as well. Now you can take your tweezers and gently pull out the beetle's underwings. Unfold the wings and place a translucent/transparent piece of paper on top of the wings once they are in a good position. Then pin through the paper around the wings to hold them in place. Finally, wait 24-48 hours for your speciment to dry. Once it's all dry you can mount your beetle however you would like!</p>
