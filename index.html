            <p id="hp">The hercules beetle! This beetle is one of the largest beetle species, varying in length between 2 and 7 inches. As their name suggests they are very strong and can lift up to 850 times their weight. </p>

            <p id="bp">The bombardier beetle! This beetle holds a reaction chamber in its abdomen that mixes hydroquinone and hydrogen-peroxide to spray liquid acid from its rear. This explosive blast can reach up to 212&#176F and bombardier beetles are able to aim this within a 270&#176 range.</p>

            <p id="sp">The stag beetle! This beetle is easily identified for their large mandibles. It is only the male beetles that have such prominent jaws, as they use them to fight off other males to mate. Stag beetles are essential to the ecosystem as they clean up forests by feeding on rotting wood.</p>
