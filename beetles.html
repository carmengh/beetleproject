            <h2>What Is A Beetle?</h2>
            <p>Beetles are one of the most common insects in the world. But what classifies a beetle as a beetle? Like all insects, beetles have six legs and three main body parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. Beetles also have compound eyes that allow them to efficiently detect movement and patterns of light. They have two pairs of wings; however unlike other insects, their exterior wing is a hard protective shell called "elytra". </p>

            <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
            <p>The life span of a beetle varies between species, however their life cycles are typically all the same. They all start off as eggs where they will hatch to become larve, which grows into a pupa and eventually an adult. There are extra substages during their larval stage known as instars. The first instar is when the larvae first hatches from its egg. After the grub starts growing larger and starts shedding its skin, it reaches the second instar. The larvae will continue growing and eventually will shed its skin again in which it will reach the third instar. The time span between each instar depends on the beetle species: for example, the third instar can last a few months or even years depending if it is a larger beetle species. Once it is ready, the larvae will begin its process of pupating. Pupation is a beetle's last stage before completely metamorphosing into an adult. The larvae will darken into a yellowish-brown color, where it will become a pupa, and begin to cocoon itself. Some larvae will create their cocoons from dirt or even clay! After weeks, or even months depending on the species, the beetle will emerge from its pupae as a full adult. </p>

            <h2>Habitats and Roles</h2>
            <p>Beetles are found in just about every habitat. With so many diverse species you can find them in forests, mountains, deserts, and even in bodies of water! They are absolutely essential for their ecosystem as they serve as decomposers and sometimes even pollinators.  </p>

            <h2>Males and Females</h2>
            <p>Beetles are dimorphic, which means that there are structural differences between males and females. These structural differences are due to evolutionary developments based on the differing roles between males and females. For example, males will typically have large horns connected to their head or thorax, which they use to fight off other males to mate with females. Acorn weevils are also a great example of beetle dimorphism. Female acorn weevils have longer snouts than males as they use their snout as a drill to create deep holes in acorns where they store their eggs.</p>
